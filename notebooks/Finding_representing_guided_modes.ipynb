    "Modes are solutions of Maxwell's equations in a multilayered structure absent any source or any outside excitation. In order to find them, one has theoretically to solve the dispersion relation for a given $\\omega$, and by doing so find the wavevector $k_x$ in the complex plane, and then to find the corresponding coefficients of the plane waves in each layer to represent the mode. The mode can be interpreted physically as an excitation which took place inside the structure at $\\pm \\infty$, and thus as a guided or a leaky mode. \n",
