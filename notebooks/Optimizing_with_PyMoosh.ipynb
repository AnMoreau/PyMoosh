    "# Optimization with PyMoosh\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical and engineering problems require an optimization phase, in order to find an object or a structure that best fits a given constraint or objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the first step is to define the objective the structure must meet or approach. This can be as simple as  maximising or minimising a specific parameter (e.g. reflectivity or transmissivity at a given wavelength), or as complex as angularly separating polarizations or maximizing the amount of energy absorbed in a specific layer of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, this definition needs to be written as an **objective function**, that counts the proximity to the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example below, we simply want to design a dielectric mirror, so we want to maximise the reflectance on a given range of wavelengths.\n",
    "For this, we will be using the *coefficient(...)* function that returns the reflectivity and transmitivity of a structure."
