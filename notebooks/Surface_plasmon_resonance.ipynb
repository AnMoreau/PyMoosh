    "# Surface Plasmon Resonance with PyMoosh\n",

    "In this notebook, we will explore how PyMoosh allows to simulate and understand surface plasmon resonance in the case of a prism coupler. You can do actual research with an apparently so simple program. See [this paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r6b2zv2bprzueou/PhysRevA.94.063808.pdf?dl=0). You'll recognize the plots.\n",
