    "As Moosh allows to compute quickly the absorption in each layer using the ```absorption``` function, it is possible to compute the current this would generate if we assume every charge carrier generated by every photon absorbed in the structure is finally captured and contributes to the current. This is here the short-circuit current which is computed, in these conditions. The conversion efficiency is the ratio of the short-circuit current to the the theoretical current generated by a perfectly absorbing material.\n",

See how, it really improves things on the 375-750 nm range, especially for the part of the spectrum where the photon density is at its highest. Something we had not asked but that the AR does, is to reflect the IR part of the spectrum very efficiently - so that you can choose what to absorb and what not to absorb (heating is detrimental to the performances of any photovoltaic device).
