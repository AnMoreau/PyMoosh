Total internal reflection is thus a way to generate an evanescent wave. This evanescent wave can then be used to excite any guided mode.\n",

    "What we are seeing is the guided mode in the upper waveguide being transferred to the second one by evanescent coupling (tunneling if you like) and then back in the upper waveguide where is leaks in the prism. Since it leaks only half of the time, light propagates further than when only one waveguide is present.
